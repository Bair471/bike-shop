        <h1>UNLEASH EACH RIDER’S FULL POTENTIAL</h1>
            <p>
                Each of us has our own challenges, goals and reasons to ride. At Giant, our purpose is to help you unleash your full potential no matter the chosen path. 
                
                We do this with our products, our people and the stories we share. Come feel what it’s like to be limitless. Come ride with us.
                
                Giant is the world’s leading brand of high-quality bicycles and cycling gear. Part of the Giant Group, which was founded in 1972, the brand combines craftsmanship, technology and innovative design.
                
                Giant has long been one of cycling’s main catalysts for change. We introduced lighter, stronger aluminum frames at a time when the industry standard was steel. 
                
                We were first to make carbon fiber bikes widely available to the world. We defined the look and feel of modern road racing bikes with our Compact Road technology. And we revolutionized off-road performance bikes with Maestro Suspension.
                
                Today, this spirit of innovation is stronger than ever. Our collection of gear and apparel, developed and tested by some of the top teams and athletes in pro racing, continues to expand. Our industry-leading E-bikes are redefining what’s possible for cyclists of all abilities.
                
                These innovations serve a larger purpose. Winning races and producing lighter, stronger, faster bikes is important, but there’s more to it than that. We believe the journey can be just as rewarding as the achievement, and that nothing beats the feeling of experiencing our successes together.
                
                We are builders and innovators, but we are also a global community of cyclists. We are athletes, adventurers and advocates for cycling. We are Tour de France racers, singletrack explorers, neighbors and friends.
                
                Put it all together, and Giant is a complete ecosystem of bikes, gear and cycling services, seamlessly connected and always accessible. You can find us at our more than 12,000 retail stores around the world or connect with us online from wherever you are.
